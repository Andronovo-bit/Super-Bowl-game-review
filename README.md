# Super-Bowl-game-review
In this project, the interaction of data about Super Bowl matches was examined.

This project looked at the interplay of data related to Super Bowl encounters.

You will find answers to questions like the following.

What are the most extreme game results?

How does the game affect the television audience?

How has the audience count, TV ratings and advertising cost changed over time?

Who are the most successful musicians in terms of halftime show performances?

The data set used in this project is taken from Wikipedia. It consists of three CSV files, one representing game data, one representing TV data and one representing half-time musician data for 52 Super Bowls by 2018.
